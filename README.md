# Aki-API.ts

I am a heavy TypeScript user, and Aki-API does not come with Type Declarations. So I decided to make it myself. All of the credit of the code goes to [jgoralcz](https://github.com/jgoralcz) who wrote the library. I just added some simple typings which aren't that great (a lot of `any`s)
